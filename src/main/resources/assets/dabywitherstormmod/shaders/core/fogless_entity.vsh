    // it comes overwhelmingly from the sky, so an upward face catches far more of it than a
    // downward one. Grading between the two by the normal's Y darkens undersides, overhangs and
    // the inside of every gap in the mass, which is what the eye reads as self-shadowing -- and
    // it costs one multiply per vertex, no shadow map, no extra pass, nothing to sample.
