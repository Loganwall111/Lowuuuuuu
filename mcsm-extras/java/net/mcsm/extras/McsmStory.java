/**
 * MCSM 1.9.100 -- the briefing.
 *
 * The user asked for "MCSM instructions" in the mod. The Story Mode game states
 * them as Jesse's narration, and the mod has no place that does, so this adds
 * one: the first time a player gets close enough to a live storm, they are told
 * what they are looking at and what the rules are -- once, per player, per
 * session. Not a help book to go and read: the storm tells you.
 *
 * Deliberately server-side and deliberately plain (sendSystemMessage), so it
 * needs no client GUI and cannot desync.
