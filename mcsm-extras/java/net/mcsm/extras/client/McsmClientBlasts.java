/**
 * MCSM 1.9.109 -- the client half of the expanding blasts.
 *
 * McsmFxDriver arms a blast from the storm's own tick (the die() and
 * addSubGrowth() hooks), and that tick stops being called the moment the storm
 * is removed. A death sequence driven only from there freezes about a second
 * after it starts, which is the "one-tick puff" that kept being reported no
 * matter how the geometry was tuned. This class is driven instead from
 * LevelRenderer.render -- once per rendered frame, for as long as the player is
 * in a world -- and spawns its particles locally, so the front keeps travelling
 * for the full five seconds whether or not the entity still exists.
 *
 * It lives in the client package and is reachable only from a client mixin,
 * because McsmFxDriver is loaded on a dedicated server as well and must never
 * have to resolve Minecraft or ClientLevel. In single-player the client and the
 * integrated server share one JVM, so the blasts the server armed are the ones
 * this draws; stepping here also stamps McsmFxDriver's client clock, which is
 * how the server half knows to stand down and no particle is spawned twice.
 *
 * Wrapped end to end: a visual can never break a frame.
