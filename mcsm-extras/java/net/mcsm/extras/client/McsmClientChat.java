/**
 * MCSM 1.9.110 -- the build announces itself IN CHAT.
 *
 * Four rounds of "I see none of the changes" ended the same way: the evidence
 * that would have settled it lived in latest.log and in the mods list, i.e. in
 * files the player has to go and dig out while holding a suspicion. Chat is
 * where the player already is -- they screenshot it -- so the build number is
 * now spoken there once per world load, and the death/rise sequences report
 * when they arm. A screenshot of chat after this build therefore answers both
 * "which jar is loaded?" and "did the hook fire at all?" with no file hunting.
 *
 * These lines are ours and only ours: Dabicco's mod prints nothing like them,
 * so seeing them is itself proof the MCSM jar is the one running.
 *
 * Client-only class, called only from client mixins.
