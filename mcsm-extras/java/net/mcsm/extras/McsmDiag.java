/**
 * MCSM 1.9.75 -- startup + runtime diagnostics for OUR patches.
 *
 * Every defect chased so far (invisible storm, dead shadows, missing glare
 * blob) had the same investigative problem: there was no way to tell from the
 * game whether our mixins had applied at all. A silently skipped injector and
 * a correctly applied injector whose feature is disabled downstream look
 * identical from the outside.
 *
 * The mod itself already prints useful lines, e.g.
 *     [dabywitherstormmod][shadow] off: ... a shader pack is active ...
 *     [dabywitherstormmod] storm shadow map FAILED, shadows off: ...
 *
 * We now print alongside them under [mcsm], so a single log grep answers
 * "did the patch load, and what did it decide?".
 *
 * Everything here is fail-safe: diagnostics must never break a frame.
